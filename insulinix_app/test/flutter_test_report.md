## 🧠 Observations

- The core UI components of `PodStatusScreen` performed as expected under all standard and edge data conditions.
- Your test suite now includes **extreme values** to test the **limits** of the app's response logic — a strong step toward robustness and patient safety.

---

## ⚠️ Edge Case Concerns

### ❗ Battery at 300%
This value exceeds physiological and hardware constraints. Displaying this without a warning could:
- Confuse users
- Indicate a firmware or transmission error
- Lead to a **false sense of security**

### ❗ Pod Fill at 300ml (beyond safe max of 200ml)
This also exceeds normal capacity. Unchecked, it may:
- Hide a device malfunction
- Risk **overdosing** if misinterpreted

---

## ✅ Recommendations

> ⚠️ Even though these edge cases **passed the UI rendering test**, they highlight a **critical safety issue** in logic validation.

**Suggested Safeguards:**
1. **Validation Layer**: Clamp or reject incoming values outside safe thresholds (e.g., `battery > 100`, `fill > 200`).
2. **Warning UI**: Display a warning banner, toast, or modal with:
   - `"Unexpected sensor value received"`  
   - `"Please reconnect or contact support"`  
3. **Log the incident**: Include local logging or cloud error reporting for anomalies.
4. **Unit + Widget Tests**: Add tests that **expect** an error/warning UI when out-of-bounds data is received.
